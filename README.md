# Home-Assistant-Blueprint-Group-Sync
This Home Assistant blueprint allows you to sync the state of multiple switches, turning one switch on when another is turned on, and vice versa. It's perfect for scenarios where you want to keep two or more switches in sync, such as controlling lights in different rooms, or managing devices in a smart home setup.
